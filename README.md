# Khoyapaya

Khoyapaya is a compassionate initiative developed for a Computer Engineering diploma final year project. Leveraging PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and Bootstrap, it addresses the issue of orphan children in India. This website facilitates child adoption, providing a platform for potential adopters to access information about orphan children affiliated with a specific NGO. Users can easily register, view child profiles, and schedule appointments with the NGO for adoption. An admin panel allows authorized personnel to manage child information, adding, updating, or deleting records. Khoyapaya aims to connect orphan children with caring individuals seeking to adopt and make a positive impact on their lives.
